Tutorial on how to craft your summary statistics for simulator-based inference.


In the added notebook `tutorial.ipynb` you find two simple examples that illustrate the importance of crafting your summary statistics when you use simulator-based inference (sbi). This notebook is not intended to give you a one size fits all approach. In fact it argues against this: it argues for the modelling analyst to carefully construct their summary statistics in order to (i) further help the analyst understand his observed data, (ii) help him discover exactly what he wants the model to recover from the observation and (iii) dramatically help the inference framework itself.

In the end you are encouraged, with what you've learnt, to further improve on the 2nd example: tuning the parametrs of a passive Hodgkin-Huxley model.
